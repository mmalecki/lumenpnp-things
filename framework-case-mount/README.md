# Framework printable case mount for LumenPnP
This is the source code of the mount for the [Framework printable case](https://www.printables.com/model/294573-3d-printable-mainboard-case)
I used to attach it to my LumenPnP. It mounts on the lower left extrusion, right
next to the the control unit, enabling easy cable routing.

To print, print two copies: one as-is, the **other one mirrored along the X axis**.
Print laying on the "outer" face.

To mount, two M4x16 and two M4 t-nuts are required.

1. Put LumenPnP on its back legs.
2. Affix the back-side mount in the desired location. Fasten the bolt just so.  
(Note: the pictures show one of the possible mounting locations that does not
obstruct air flow through either the control unit, or the Framework. The other
one is closer to the front extrusion, but that coincides with the default
discard location. I picked the former because I'm yet to make a discard bin.)
3. Use the Framework case to figure out where the other mount goes. Make sure
it doesn't obstruct any cable routing or air flow.  
Put it further than it will be and affix it just so.
4. Make sure the back-side mount sits square with the extrusion and fasten the bolt.
5. Rest the Framework case (mind where the power button is) in the back-side mount.
Unfasten, put the front-side mount on it, make sure it sits square against the
extrusion and tighten the mounting bolt. 

This is what I figure is the safest way. You could also fumble about 
and almost drop the case a couple of times throughout the entire ordeal.
